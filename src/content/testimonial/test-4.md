    Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
    learning from their experiences was easy.

    “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program
    gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
    junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
    an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”
